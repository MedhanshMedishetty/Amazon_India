Amazon India Sales Analysis
SQL | Power BI | Excel

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon Indiaâ€™s large-scale sales data consisting of over 128,000 records. The goal was to transform raw e-commerce data into actionable insights that help stakeholders understand market behavior, optimize operations, and enhance sales performance.

Objective:
With a rapidly growing online marketplace, companies like Amazon face challenges in tracking sales effectiveness across regions, fulfillment channels, and product categories. The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs), identifies trends, and aids strategic business decisions.

Tools and Technologies Used:

* MySQL: Used to clean, filter, and transform raw data efficiently
* Excel: Assisted in initial data exploration and sampling
* Power BI: Designed comprehensive visual dashboards
* DAX: Created custom calculated measures and KPIs for deeper analysis

Key Features and Insights:

* Region-wise revenue, total orders, and average order value
* Category-wise breakdown of units sold, total revenue, and profitability
* Comparison between Fulfilled by Amazon and Merchant orders
* Status-wise order distribution (Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)
* Smart slicers for real-time filtering by region, category, and delivery type

Impact:
The final Power BI dashboard enables users to drill down into granular performance metrics, compare product and location-wise sales, and identify bottlenecks or high-performing segments. This kind of reporting is essential for sales forecasting and campaign optimization in large e-commerce ecosystems.

Deliverables:

* MySQL scripts for data cleaning and transformation
* Power BI .pbix file for the visual dashboard
* Exported PNGs of dashboard visuals

Live Preview:
Screenshots and highlights of the dashboard are included in this repository.
